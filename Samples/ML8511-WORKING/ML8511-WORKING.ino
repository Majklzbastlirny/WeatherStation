 The ML8511 UV Sensor outputs an analog signal in relation to the amount of UV light it detects.

 Connect the following ML8511 breakout board to Arduino:
 3.3V = 3.3V
 OUT = A0
 GND = GND
 EN = 3.3V
 3.3V = A1
 These last two connections are a little different. Connect the EN pin on the breakout to 3.3V on the breakout.
 This will enable the output. Also connect the 3.3V pin of the breakout to Arduino pin 1.

 This example uses a neat trick. Analog to digital conversions rely completely on VCC. We assume
 this is 5V but if the board is powered from USB this may be as high as 5.25V or as low as 4.75V:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power Because of this unknown window it makes the ADC fairly inaccurate
 in most cases. To fix this, we use the very accurate onboard 3.3V reference (accurate within 1%). So by doing an
 ADC on the 3.3V pin (A1) and then comparing this against the reading from the sensor we can extrapolate
 a true-to-life reading no matter what VIN is (as long as it's above 3.4V).

 Test your sensor by shining daylight or a UV LED: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8662

 This sensor detects 280-390nm light most effectively. This is categorized as part of the UVB (burning rays)
 spectrum and most of the UVA (tanning rays) spectrum.

 There's lots of good UV radiation reading out there:
